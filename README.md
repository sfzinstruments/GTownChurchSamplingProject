# "G-Town Church Sampling Project" by Tobias Marberger

Converted by [S. Christian Collins] to SFZ format from the original
GigaSampler/EXS24 version.

## Details

Recorded in his local church in Grebbestad, Sweden by music producer
Tobias Marberger, this set of music samples should be invaluable to amateur
and professional musicians alike.

This SFZ version is designed for use with the ARIA Engine, which can be found in
the free [Plogue sforzando] VSTi plugin. Compatibility with other SFZ-compliant
samplers cannot be guaranteed.

In this conversion, I have added round-robin sample alternations and other features
that were not present in the original versions. In some cases, I have also taken
samples that were previously spread out over many keys, turning them into
a single key velocity-split multisample with round-robins.
The application of these techniques is not applied fully equally across
the instruments, but my hope is that it makes these samples more musically
playable than they were in their original incarnations.

I have not yet documented the key ranges and functions for each instrument,
but in sforzando, you can see the label of the group you are currently playing
on the "Info" tab in the GUI to know what is assigned to each key range.
You will also see additional controls for some instruments on the "Controls" tab,
for example, note release length.
